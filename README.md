# Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Labwork

This is labwork corresponding to the course Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML). Every Machine Learning algorithm is implemented from scratch without the usage of any ML libraries or Frameworks. Furthermore, the algorithms those are implemented from scratch are often compared with various python libraries used to perform the same task. This repository contains all the work done in 11 Lab sessions. Every ipynb file has corresponding PDF file to preview the progress of the notebook until my last run.
